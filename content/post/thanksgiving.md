Happy Thanksgiving to all the friends and family.

Thank you Lord for all the blessings. Thank you for helping us go through all the ups and downs of life.Thank you for helping us stay positive. The Almighty God has to be thanked for everything.

I am grateful to all my friends for staying with me through thick and thin. Thank you friends for understanding me even when words failed to convey.

Family also has my gratitude because we can conveniently sail through the troubled waters jointly holding hands in hand.

God , family and friends also help us to share the joyous moments so that we all can smile and enjoy the gifts and blessings together.

Thanksgiving is a day not just to utter the word Thank You but to feel it within so that the feeling of warmth stays with us all through the whole year.
