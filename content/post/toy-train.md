The Kalka-Shima railway line prvided a comfortable means of transport from the
plains to the mountanous regions of Shima, which was the summer capital of the
British Raj. Built between 1898 and 1903, this 96.6km single narrow-guage line
passes through 102 tunnels, 864 bridges, and 918 curves and was an engineering
feat. In fact, even now, the multi-arched viaduct gallery bridge at Kanoh is
the highest in India. In 2008, UNESCO gave the status of *Heritage Toy Train*
to his railway line.
