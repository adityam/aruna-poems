```poem
In the country  I was born,
There woman's power is adorned.

Laxmi, the bestower of wealth.
Durga, the vanquisher of enemies.

Sarasvati, the patron of knowledge.
And Siddhi-Datri, the angel of harmony.

Be exalted the whole year, not just for a day,
Maintain your esteem, that's all I pray.

Don't vilify or trample others to rise,
Trust your ability, and soar the skiess.

Be honest, be creative, be loved.
And live with your head held high.

Your life is peerless, Believe in your powers,
Don't wait for an international day to tell you so.
```
