```poem
Born in a country where women power has been worshipped.
You are given strength as Durga, and demons were killed. 
As the Goddess Lakshmi  finances were under your Hand. 
As Saraswati the  arts and sciences were  blessed.
Not for a day but whole year, in different forms you are worshipped.

Hold your head High,
Keep your words sweet,
respect your own being. 
Don't criticize women, or crack jokes on them, 
Never step on others to rise higher. 
Always remember, you are capable, believe in yourself, 
Fly high but keep your eyes on the ground, 

To be born a woman is prestigious and symbol of love, 
you are the creator of the world.
Honour it and keep it's honour high, 
Don't wait for One International Day to celebrate, 
celebrate everyday as Women's Day.
```
