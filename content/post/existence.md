In this world some species are becoming extinct. There is concern about the Bees now, but each species has an important role to play. We live in this world where we are dependent on each other directly or indirectly.We all breathe in the same air that the other is exhaling. We are taking warmth and light from the same sun. We are part of the same consciousness.

Sometimes in the ego and pride when one feels that "You Don't Exist",that means they are questioning the very existance of the universe.
God is present in all living and non-living beings. All beings in the universe have a unique place, wheather we want them or not. Please let everyone live, breathe and exist. This world belongs to all. So, coexist with peace. Live and let live.
