```poem
When we don't accept an undesired event,
It becomes Anger;...
When we accept it,
It becomes Tolerance....

When we don't accept uncertainty,
It becomes Fear;...
When we accept it,
It becomes Adventure....

When we don't accept other's bad behaviour towards us,
It becomes Hatred;...
When we accept it,
It becomes Forgiveness....

When we don't accept other's Success,
It becomes Jealousy;...
When we accept it,
It becomes Inspiration....

Acceptance is the key for handling life well...
