Happy New year and Season's Greetings to all my Family and friends,

```poem
We all know that  Time and tide wait for none,
every new year comes to bid adieu to  earlier one ,
Angels come flying to to wish us the best of life,

They tell us  not to regret or fret over the past,
move on , gently cross your path,
look beyond the horizon,
The new sun rises 
to welcome the new beginning,
There stands our  Lord Krishna,
Playing His flute with a gentle smile,
He stretches His hand to hold ours,
with faith and belief,we cross the mile,
with love and forgiveness we pause for a while,
with determination and resilience,we take a stride,
“this too shall pass” with this in mind
In the journey of life we take a confident ride.
Krishna indicates towards the positive light,
make best use of what is with you ,
you will see the side that is bright,
New Year is a time to celebrate,
the new beginning  of life.

I wish you A very Happy New year 2020 
I wish you all have a very joyous , healthy and Peaceful life .
Aruna 
```
