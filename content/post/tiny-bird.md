```poem
A tiny bird came flying, 
 top branch it was sitting, 
 focused to take rest far a while, 
 It went again in the blue sky, 
to be in the vastness of the supreme being.

   The soul comes in the world, 
   to complete it's Karma bond, 
   goes back to be one
   with the Almighty light, 
 Don't carry the baggage
              travel light, 
   It's all possible with
         loosing your Might.
 This small bird comes to show the Light.
