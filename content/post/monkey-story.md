Monkeys are part of life in Shima. They live in a group in a very disciplined
way as I experienced when I was in school. My room was
just next to a varendah. One sunday morning I heard some commotion in my
room, peeped out of my quilt, and saw a big monkey leader sitting at the end
of my bed where there was a small almirah with one big bag of manges another
one with Eclairs. Six monkeys were standing in a row in the verandah. The leader took one mango and threw it out. One
of the monkey's caught it and walked away. Then the next monkey came and the
process repeated until all monkeys had their share. In the end, the leader
took one mango and one *Eclair* for himself, as a reward. 
It was a disciplined show and this encounter has always remained fresh in my mind

I was telling this story to my granddaughter, and made a drawing for her to
understand. She has seen monkeys only in the zoo and cannot imagine monkeys
coming in the house.
