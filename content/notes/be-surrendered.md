title: Be Surrendered
---

When we remain as a small pond, a stone will create a big ripple. If somebody says something, that can blow your peace off. So the peace is thrown off by people around you. But when you become an ocean, even a big mountain falling into it, does not affect it. Being an ocean, we behave like a pond â€“ that is the wonder. The greatest wonder is man who is an ocean of peace and joy, behaves as though he is a little pond when he is disturbed by any little small thing.

You go crazy over little insignificant things and that worries you over and over again, day and night for several years. Once you are surrendered, there comes a depth in you and nothing what so ever can throw you off.
