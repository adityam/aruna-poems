The Christ Church on the Ridge is the most popular landmark of the town. When in the 1830s, the British population grew to about 700, a ramshackle church began to operate in a wooden and thatched roof building very near to where Ladies Park came up. A few years later an earthquake destroyed it, and it was decided to have a solid structure. Colonel J.T. Boileau designed this as early as 1844 at the best location, next to Upper Bazaar. A portion of the church was built quickly and services commenced. Most of the structure except the clock tower and the porch were completed by 1857, when the church was consecrated. The clock tower and porch were added in 1873. The Church became a central attraction, particularly after the Upper Bazaar was cleared as a result of the fire in 1876, and the Ridge was leveled to house the water tank. Most of the central spires on the roof were lost in the snowfall of 1961.

There was a grave of a lady on the left side in a lawn.
Apparently she was buried in the winter of 1945, when due to heavy snowfall
it was not possible to reach the cemetery. The grave and the lawn were removed 
in 1970s and replaced by concrete. Today the church is the 
most photographed building in the town. The beautiful organ
still plays the divine music
