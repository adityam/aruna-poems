<div class="h1-title">Pandemic</div>

<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-poem" data-lang="poem">The scare of COVID19 has brought everyone down to knees, 
The whole world was flying high to reach the skies, 
To explore the moon, to reach Mars, to touch the Sun, 
There was no thought for the Planet Earth.

Oceans polluted, ponds and rivers dried, 
Trees were cut, forest fires burnt like hearth, 
Animals ran around to save their lives, 
They lost their families and habitats, 
They cried silently before God. 

Humans are an intelligent race, 
They use knowledge to brighten their face.
Run to achieve name, fame and heights, 
Trample nature to take long flights.

In the rat race to achieve too much,
they forget the glory of soul and lose touch,
Strong viruses sprang to teach a lesson, 
love and happiness is your mission.

Don&#39;t mistreat but Nurture Nature, 
Protect vegetation and save water, 
Don&#39;t be greedy, help the needy.
God gave us beautiful Earth.

Mother nature should be loved, 
It is never too late to mend.
Strive to mend your mistakes,
Make it a better place to live.

Join hands and promise yourself,
Treat every being with love and care. 
Stay indoors for a little while more, 
Rejuvenate hidden abilities and bring them fore, 
love and care is your being, take care of nature.

With folded hands bow to the Supreme Being, 
He is there to Bless us with strength for doing. 
This Phase shall also pass. Believe in His blessings, 
God is with us and will always be with our beings.
