<div class="h1-title">Monkey story</div>

<p>Monkeys are part of life in Shima. They live in a group in a very disciplined
way as I experienced when I was in school. My room was
just next to a varendah. One sunday morning I heard some commotion in my
room, peeped out of my quilt, and saw a big monkey leader sitting at the end
of my bed where there was a small almirah with one big bag of manges another
one with Eclairs. Six monkeys were standing in a row in the verandah. The leader took one mango and threw it out. One
of the monkey&rsquo;s caught it and walked away. Then the next monkey came and the
process repeated until all monkeys had their share. In the end, the leader
took one mango and one <em>Eclair</em> for himself, as a reward.
It was a disciplined show and this encounter has always remained fresh in my mind</p>
<p>I was telling this story to my granddaughter, and made a drawing for her to
understand. She has seen monkeys only in the zoo and cannot imagine monkeys
coming in the house.</p>
