<div class="h1-title">What RECCA does</div>

<pre><code class="language-poem" data-lang="poem">our life was going at own pace, 
suddenly realized everything has stopped, 
I looked around and
found some are quiet, 
and cry in their heart, 
 get up and  bring it out, 
with silent mode we thought, 
words are empty, say something
 but conveys different. 

Montreal is a cultural melting pot, 
Surely, seniors must have a spot. 
Or so it would appear, 
If you didn&#39;t look beneath the veneer. 
Those who come from far away, 
Don&#39;t want to affray. 
They cry in their heart, 
Afraid their life may fall apart. 
At Recca, we try the audorous task, 
Of trying to get them to lift their mask. 
So, we go to immigrant communities, 
And tell them all too familiar stories. 
They immediately see the abusive pattern, 
And often have strong reactions. 
We hope that they act on their thoughts, 
And break out their mental knots. 
  knots started opening up, 
 People started giving words to silence, 
sorrows started coming out, 
many hands joined together, started holding up, 
it was shown there is no secret or shame, 
language knowledge is just a game, 
Canada wants people to live with dignity, 
here is a chance to live with love and unity, 
Admins, cops and CLSC are there to hold you, 
Take a step forward and they will guide you, 
This is what RECCA shows you. </code></pre>
